<a href="http://mhacks.org">Mhacks</a> was this weekend; I had decided not to go because I didn't want to get far behind on schoolwork. Naturally, I have spent most of the past few days getting behind on schoolwork. I procrastinated by playing around with the MEAN stack (minus mongo) which I have been wanting to get familiar with for a long time. I started with <a href="https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io">angular-socket-io-seed</a> and ended up with <a href="https://github.com/yoavz/TSA">TSA - Twitter Sentiment Analysis</a>. It's a live twitter stream that allows you to visualize the sentiment of tweets containing a given phrase/hashtag. There's a live version up <a href="http://54.219.112.10/">here</a> as of today, but it may not be up there for long.

Angular is pretty damn frustrating to learn. It's one of those technologies which looks fine and dandy in trivial tutorials (dare I say elegant?), but then you try to apply it to a real use case and run into a shitload of issues. Still, it's undeniable that AngularJS is the most powerful front-end solution out there today for a responsive site. And I've heard that once you get over the learning curve it's actually <i>Fun</i> to use. I'll believe it when/if I get there.

I like NodeJS and Express <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>. Having the entirety of your stack written in one language is really nice, even if that language is Javascript. I used <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> and the npm package <a href="https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter">ntwitter</a> to plugin to the twitter streaming api and transmit messages to client-side, which also went pretty smoothly. The sentiment stuff was nothing fancy, just plugging into the npm package <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/sentiment">sentiment</a> to get a very basic analysis. Next step is to build my own wordlist and analyzer, maybe one customized for twitter?

I'll be starting to work on the <a href="http://lahacks.com/">LAHacks</a> iOS app soon with some smart guys. It's gonna be dope.
