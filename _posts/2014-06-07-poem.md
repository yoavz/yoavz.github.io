I found this <a href="http://www.poetry.com/historical_users/4348644-Yoav%20%20Zimmerman/923438-Brooke-the-Bug">poem</a> that I wrote in the 2nd grade:

	Brooke the Bug liked to eat candy 
	and so did her best friend named Mandy 
	They ate candy all day long 
	and when they ate it they sang a song 
	Shiki, Shoko, Shuki, Shandy
