  <h1>  </h1>

  <p>I recently submitted my iOS application, Swiplur, to the app store. This is my first mobile application and first time doing any type of mobile development. In fact, I have been spending a good chunk of my time for the past two months learning iOS development and then another building Swiplur. While waiting for apple to review my creation, I thought I could take some time to recap some thoughts I&rsquo;ve had about mobile/iOS development.</p>

<p>If you have worked with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> before, you probably know about the Storyboard, Apple&rsquo;s slick new graphical interface for developing a user interface for iOS applications. When I first was doing research into iOS dev, my instinct was to stay away from it like the plague. I&rsquo;m not sure why that was; maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve never used a visual programming interface or maybe it&rsquo;s because it reminded me of Microsoft Powerpoint. Regardless, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550">stanford course</a> that I was following used storyboard extensively, so I reluctanctly gave it a shot. And I kept on waiting for this moment I had imagined, where I would curse the visual programming interface for not giving me enough fine control over development and would switch to purely programmatic development like a Real Developer. But the first version of my app is done, and that moment still hasn&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p><img src="/images/storyboard.jpg" title="It can't be this easy..." alt="alt-text" /></p>

<p>The above is a screenshot of the side by side Storyboard-Code view for Swiplur. It almost looks too good to be true, but let me tell you folks, this is the real deal. Simply drag out any component from the sidebar and control-drag to link it up the rest of your components and/or code. The important thing to remember is that Storyboard is not a <i>replacement</i> for pure code, but rather a <i>supplemental tool</i>. Although building the UI may be as simple as creating a powerpoint presentation, one still needs to understand object oriented programming and the MVC design pattern to finish the rest of the app. In other words, if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, you will not be successful. But if you do know how to code, Storyboard can vastly speed up your development cycle.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel like most developers, when faced with the decision of CLI vs GUI, will tend toward the side of command line interface. A command line is familiar, very well supported, and most importantly, standardized over time. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should be afraid of GUI&rsquo;s. There are many cases, such as XCode Storyboard, where it increases programming productivity and clarity. I could <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y9CC_lA4n0">easily</a> see some tools like these becoming the future of programming.</p>
