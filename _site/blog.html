  	<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bzniPwy.png" title="Classic twitter vulgarity" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://mhacks.org">Mhacks</a> was this weekend; I had decided not to go because I didn&rsquo;t want to get far behind on schoolwork. Naturally, I have spent most of the past few days getting behind on schoolwork. I procrastinated by playing around with the MEAN stack (minus mongo) which I have been wanting to get familiar with for a long time. I started with <a href="https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io">angular-socket-io-seed</a> and ended up with <a href="https://github.com/yoavz/TSA">TSA - Twitter Sentiment Analysis</a>. It&rsquo;s a live twitter stream that allows you to visualize the sentiment of tweets containing a given phrase/hashtag. There&rsquo;s a live version up <a href="http://54.219.112.10/">here</a> as of today, but it may not be up there for long.</p>

<p>Angular is pretty damn frustrating to learn. It&rsquo;s one of those technologies which looks fine and dandy in trivial tutorials (dare I say elegant?), but then you try to apply it to a real use case and run into a shitload of issues. Still, it&rsquo;s undeniable that AngularJS is the most powerful front-end solution out there today for a responsive site. And I&rsquo;ve heard that once you get over the learning curve it&rsquo;s actually <i>Fun</i> to use. I&rsquo;ll believe it when/if I get there.</p>

<p>I like NodeJS and Express <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>. Having the entirety of your stack written in one language is really nice, even if that language is Javascript. I used <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> and the npm package <a href="https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter">ntwitter</a> to plugin to the twitter streaming api and transmit messages to client-side, which also went pretty smoothly. The sentiment stuff was nothing fancy, just plugging into the npm package <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/sentiment">sentiment</a> to get a very basic analysis. Next step is to build my own wordlist and analyzer, maybe one customized for twitter?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be starting to work on the <a href="http://lahacks.com/">LAHacks</a> iOS app soon with some smart guys. It&rsquo;s gonna be dope.</p>

<p>Swiplur, the app I&rsquo;ve been developing for the past few weeks, dropped onto the iOS App Store yesterday! It&rsquo;s a swipe marketplace for college campuses that helps facilitate the buying and selling of meal swipes for dining halls. It currently supports UCLA and UC Davis campus, with plans to expand to more if successful. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiplur/id748927884">Check it out</a>.</p>

  <p>
  	<p>I recently submitted my iOS application, Swiplur, to the app store. This is my first mobile application and first time doing any type of mobile development. In fact, I have been spending a good chunk of my time for the past two months learning iOS development and then another building Swiplur. While waiting for apple to review my creation, I thought I could take some time to recap some thoughts I&rsquo;ve had about mobile/iOS development.</p>

<p>If you have worked with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> before, you probably know about the Storyboard, Apple&rsquo;s slick new graphical interface for developing a user interface for iOS applications. When I first was doing research into iOS dev, my instinct was to stay away from it like the plague. I&rsquo;m not sure why that was; maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve never used a visual programming interface or maybe it&rsquo;s because it reminded me of Microsoft Powerpoint. Regardless, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550">stanford course</a> that I was following used storyboard extensively, so I reluctanctly gave it a shot. And I kept on waiting for this moment I had imagined, where I would curse the visual programming interface for not giving me enough fine control over development and would switch to purely programmatic development like a Real Developer. But the first version of my app is done, and that moment still hasn&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p><img src="/images/storyboard.jpg" title="It can't be this easy..." alt="alt-text" /></p>

<p>The above is a screenshot of the side by side Storyboard-Code view for Swiplur. It almost looks too good to be true, but let me tell you folks, this is the real deal. Simply drag out any component from the sidebar and control-drag to link it up the rest of your components and/or code. The important thing to remember is that Storyboard is not a <i>replacement</i> for pure code, but rather a <i>supplemental tool</i>. Although building the UI may be as simple as creating a powerpoint presentation, one still needs to understand object oriented programming and the MVC design pattern to finish the rest of the app. In other words, if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, you will not be successful. But if you do know how to code, Storyboard can vastly speed up your development cycle.</p>

<hr />

<p>I feel like most developers, when faced with the decision of CLI vs GUI, will tend toward the side of command line interface. A command line is familiar, very well supported, and most importantly, standardized over time. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should be afraid of GUI&rsquo;s. There are many cases, such as XCode Storyboard, where it increases programming productivity and clarity. I could <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y9CC_lA4n0">easily</a> see some tools like these becoming the future of programming.</p>

  </h1>

  <section class="byline">

  <p>
  	<p>I recently wrapped up my summer at Quixey and drove back down to school to begin my second year. It&rsquo;s been a great and productive summer, and I have learned a tremondous amount in the past three months. Here are the top takeaways from summer 2013:</p>

<p><strong> 1. Breaks are important </strong></p>

<p>Every impatient software engineer knows that bugs can be extremely frustrating. Every once in a while you encounter an issue that causes you to go insane. They usually seem trivial at first, but before you know it, minutes are turning into hours as you furiously scan through documentation, stack overflow posts, anything that may lead to a solution. The longer I spent on a bug, the more frustrated I felt, and the more compelled I felt to not give up and try to solve it more quickly. This downward time-draining cycle can be deadly. Avoid it by <strong>taking a break</strong>. Go for a jog, eat a snack, chat with a buddy, meditate, do anything that gets your mind off of the problem. Chances are when you come back, your mind will be clear and you will be ready to tackle the problem with full focus and no frustration. There have been a few late nights where I was furiously hacking away on a problem, frustrated, angry, and not making any progess. The funny thing is (after I eventually gave up and went home) I would usually come in the next morning and solve the issue within 15 minutes. Now, every time I work on a problem without making progess for an hour, I simply drop it. Effeciency is important, but breaks are necessary. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take one if you need it.</p>

<p><strong> 2. Product Management is hard </strong></p>

<p>The team I worked on this summer had some very talented engineers. I used to think that was all you needed. A team smart enough to design and engineer a product should surely be able to manage their team effectively to see that product come to fruition, right? Not exactly. Keeping a bunch of engineers on track and working toward the same goal, it turns out, is extremely difficult. Even with a daily standup, miscommunication and lack of clear direction prevented us from working at maximum effeciency for a long time. Eventually, we learned enough to start using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, but still wasted a bunch of time on management overhead. If engineers are sled dogs, then the PM is the human that builds the sled, puts the dogs on their leashes, and drives the sled in the right direction. I have a newfound respect for product management, as this summer has taught me how difficult that job is to do well. Shout out to my boy <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hadardor">Hadar</a>.</p>

<p><strong> 3. Learn git </strong></p>

<p>If you are an engineer and not already familiar with git, go <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">learn</a> it now. Seriously, you&rsquo;ll need it eventually.</p>

<p><strong> 4. Macs are amazing </strong></p>

<p>For some reason I used to have this notion that that Apple computer products were only for the non tech-savvy. But after this summer, I have to admit that I have become what I used to despise: an apple fanboy. Yes, most apple products are infuriangtly overpriced for their technical specs (a <a href="http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/">24-inch Thunderbolt Display</a> is $1000&hellip; what the fuck apple). Yes, you could get an equally powerful windows based laptop for half the price of a macbook and install ubuntu (or even a pirated copy of OS X) on it. But I&rsquo;ll be damned if the 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display I used this summer isn&rsquo;t the most beautiful machine I have ever owned. As much as they cost, haters have to admit that apple products are extremely well built and designed, to the very last detail. Plus, the OSX operating system is beautifully easy to use, for computer experts and beginners alike. If you are struggling financially, I would still opt for the fairly priced ASUS laptop. But if you have money (as most well funded startups do), I would go for the Mac everytime. <strong> Mac OSX > Linux > &hellip; > Windows. </strong></p>

<hr />

<p>I am continuing to work twenty hours a week remotely while taking classes at UCLA. It&rsquo;s been a blast. No complaints so far except that the internet here is terrible. I&rsquo;m gonna need to do something about that&hellip;</p>

<p>Here is a beautiful view of Westwood and beyond from my dorm room in Dykstra Hall:</p>

  <p>
  	<p>I heard about this new show about life in women&rsquo;s prison a few weeks back. It comes from the creators of Weeds, a show I have never been too enthusiastic about, so I was initially skeptical. But I decided to give it a chance, and boy am I glad. It turns out that female prisons (at least the way this show writes them) are actually&hellip; really intersting.</p>

<p>The show starts out slow, with the first episode hitting all the classic prison cliche&rsquo;s with a comedic tone. Some of the humor is entertaining, but the real appeal of this show to me are the diverse characters: A russian mob housewife inmate that controls the kitchen and with it, most of the prisoners. An unstable lesbian stalker aptly nicknamed &ldquo;Crazy Eyes&rdquo;. A latino daughter who gets placed in the same cell as her mother, with whom she doesn&rsquo;t get along. A racist, sexist, sadistic prison guard who all the inmates call &ldquo;Pornstache&rdquo;. And of course, a fair share of drug addicts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/oitnb.jpg" title="Guess which one is nicknamed Crazy Eyes?" alt="alt-text" /></p>

<p>The relationships all these characters develop are intricate and complex. At first it seems as though the inmates are completely divided. The are clear groups defined by race: the whites, the blacks, the latinos, and my personal favorite, &ldquo;the others&rdquo;. But as the plot thickens and the characters develop, you see that it really isn&rsquo;t that simple. Every character has depth: even ones that are introduced as one-sided personalities in the beginning of the seasons surprise you with occasional glimpses of humanity. Flashbacks in the style of <i>Lost</i> also add to this depth.</p>

<p>The main character is presented a white woman from the middle class who happened to get mixed up with some drug smuggling in her &ldquo;rebellious&rdquo; post-college period. The initial appeal of the show is her juxtaposition against the rest of the inmates, who mostly come from poverty and minority backgrounds. It&rsquo;s fascinating and hilarious to see her interact with this vastly different world she finds in prison. But what really got to me about this show is when I started to realize that, when you look past their superficial differences (ethnicity, sexual orientation, educational background), these inmates are all very similar. As one of the characters puts it, <b>&ldquo;We all make bad choices. It&rsquo;s just some of us got different bad choices to make.&rdquo;</b></p>

<hr />

<p>I highly reccomend checking this show out if you get the chance. I give the first season a 9/10 and will definitely be coming back for the second.
On a side note, I hope this trend of netflix exclusives continues; between this show, House of Cards, and Arrested Development season 4, they have proved that they can produce high quality content. Plus they just released the first half Breaking Bad Season 5, just in time for the priemiere next week! That company has got their shit together, I would love to intern there.</p>

  <p>
  	<p>I started bouldering this summer, following in the footsteps of many of my friends in the bay. The basic premise is this: you climb up a wall and then jump off when you reach the top. Then you go to another wall and repeat. To some people this comes naturally; I am not one of those people. It&rsquo;s been two weeks and the only thing I feel like I&rsquo;m getting better at the slackline the climbing gym has set up in the back.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bouldering.jpg" title="This is an example of what I cannot do" alt="alt-text" /></p>

<p>The toughest thing about climbing for me is the endurance factor. After just a few climbs it feels like my arms are going to fall off. The way I see it there are two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li> Everybody experiences this arm pain but ignores it and keeps trucking, in which case I am a pussy.</li>
<li> My arms have not built the muscle endurance to handle climbing for more than an hour at a time, in which case I am a weakling.</li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which I prefer more&hellip;</p>

  	<p>After putting it off for too long (I bought the domain name months ago), I have finally decided to go ahead and create a personal site. I have a decent amount of free time in the weekends during summer, so there is no excuse to put it off any longer. The goal is to own a space to display projects and store any interesting thoughts or experiences I come across in life. Here we go&hellip;</p>

<hr />

<p>The setup for this website was surprisingly straight-forward. I was previously experimenting with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a> on an amazon ec2 instance, but I found jekyll + github pages earlier today and realized it would be much simpler. Jekyll is a static site generator. Pretty much all you have to do is specify a few layouts, make some changes to the config file, and you&rsquo;re golden. To create a post, you simply add a markdown file to a _post directory, and jekyll handles the rest. Deploying was even simpler; create a git repo named &ldquo;yoavz.github.io&rdquo;, push your code and github automatically runs it through jekyll and serves it on a custom domain for you.</p>

<p>To make it pretty, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://github.com/holman/left">Left</a> jekyll repo by Zach Holman. I haven&rsquo;t modified the design much yet. I&rsquo;ll play around with it more in the future.</p>
